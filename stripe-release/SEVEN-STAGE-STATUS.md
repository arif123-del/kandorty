# Kandorty — seven-stage release status (2026-11-09)

**This is a preparation checkpoint, not an authorization to activate Live payments.**
GitHub PR #2 remains draft/unmerged. Do not change production Firebase Rules,
published storefront/admin, existing Workers, Stripe Live, Ziina or 98 legacy orders
without the owner's separate specific final release approval.

| # | Stage | Status | Verified scope and remaining gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Detached Cloudflare Worker and isolated Sandbox | **Completed (preparation)** | Disabled production shell and isolated test Worker prepared; Sandbox provider/payment/refund checks passed. This does not mean Live is deployed. |
| 2 | Stripe Live webhook and secrets | **Partial** | Dedicated six-event Live webhook exists but remains **disabled**; Cloudflare required secret **names** were seen but value correctness, signing and provider delivery are unverified. |
| 3 | Firebase administrator identity/security preflight | **Completed (preflight only)** | Owner-attested fresh Firebase login and server-admin membership/claim verifier passed read-only acceptance on 2026-10-30. Production release Worker admin endpoint still needs coordinated acceptance. |
| 4 | 98 historical order compatibility and preservation | **Partial / blocked** | Read-only snapshot found all 98 lack trusted server lifecycle ledger. No migration and no destructive edits. Separate owner-approved legacy-only status/cancellation policy needed. |
| 5 | Website / Android / Firebase Rules compatibility | **Partial / blocked** | Rules emulator and candidate browser security tests pass. Installed Android 2.3.0 offline fallback is unsafe for new deny-client-writes rules; unsigned/uninstalled 2.3.1 source review only. Device acceptance and coordinated migration remain. |
| 6 | Resend email and operational monitoring | **Partial** | Resend domain and manual test email: owner-confirmed delivered to designated Gmail inbox on 2026-11-09. Deduplicated alert scheduler was tested and activated on the isolated TEST Worker only; a Firestore operator alert record shows **provider-accepted at 2026-11-09T20:15:34.421Z**. Three operator settings were restored as TEST Worker secrets from its owner-configured version history and the Wrangler TEST config now preserves dashboard variables. Automatic Resend **provider acceptance** has been independently seen for two TEST alert windows; recipient-inbox confirmation for the *automatic* message, Cloudflare scheduled execution alerts, Stripe delivery/dispute alerts and backup escalation remain. The existing Resend API key is **Sending Access**, so it cannot be used to GET sent email history; the optional delivery-status reader requires a separate, owner-approved read-capable key and is OFF by default. |
| 7 | Final coordinated production activation | **Not started — approval required** | Only after stages 2, 4, 5 and 6 pass: owner must specifically authorize site/rules/backend and Live webhook activation and limited real payment/refund validation. Generic permission to finish preparation is **not** this authorization. |

## Verified test evidence

- [Current code/rules readiness](https://github.com/arif123-del/kandorty/actions/runs/42675520665): **148 code tests passed, zero failures**; rules-emulator job passed.
- [Latest successful Sandbox baseline](https://github.com/arif123-del/kandorty/actions/runs/42675227624): isolated Stripe test payments and refunds succeeded, without Live charges.
- The manual Resend test email reached the intended owner's Gmail Inbox and was shown in an owner-provided screenshot. The separate **automatic** operations alert has provider-accepted evidence in the isolated TEST Firestore operator-alert state at 2026-11-09T20:15:34.421Z, verified by a read-only GitHub Actions attempt. The automatic message's recipient inbox arrival is still unconfirmed; do not equate Resend acceptance with inbox delivery. The Gmail connector currently authenticated to a different inbox than the intended recipient and is not definitive for delivery.
- [Owner alert binding recovery](https://github.com/arif123-del/kandorty/actions/runs/42694842240): isolated TEST only, restored three previously configured alert values as encrypted Worker secrets without logging values, touching Stripe Live, or modifying production Firebase.
- [Latest code / Firebase Rules readiness](https://github.com/arif123-del/kandorty/actions/runs/42697562723): 155 code tests passed (zero failures) plus Rules compatibility checks. [Latest hosted Sandbox acceptance](https://github.com/arif123-del/kandorty/actions/runs/42697562326) succeeded. [Cloudflare TEST bindings audit](https://github.com/arif123-del/kandorty/actions/runs/42697763076) confirms Cron every five minutes, sending-only Resend secret, sender and recipient secret binding names, and secret-type alert toggle (toggle value unreadable through metadata). [TEST alert provider-state audit](https://github.com/arif123-del/kandorty/actions/runs/42697157622) found 2 provider-accepted alert records but 0 provider-delivered confirmations. This is not recipient-inbox proof.
- [Legacy orders policy](LEGACY-ORDER-PRESERVATION.md), [Android findings](ANDROID-APP-COMPATIBILITY.md), [Email configuration](ALERT-EMAIL-SETUP.md), and [production no-go](PRODUCTION-GO-NOGO.md) retain separate acceptance gates.

## Reporting rule

When a whole stage (not just a code test or subtask) meets its acceptance
criteria, report it explicitly to the owner as:
**`Stage N — [name] — COMPLETED`**. Do not describe Stage 6 as completed
until a real automatically triggered email reaches the inbox and the relevant
provider execution/errors/escalation paths are validated. Do not describe
Stage 7 as completed until an explicitly approved coordinated rollout and
real-money acceptance have succeeded.
